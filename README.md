# Caesar-Cipher-Ruby-Practice

This program runs in the terminal. 

It defines a caesar cipher method that takes a string and a number,
and then ciphers each alphabetical character in the string 
up or down in the alphabet based on the cipher while maintining
capitalization and looping to stay within letters. 

Output is the ciphered text. Program is for personal practice.
